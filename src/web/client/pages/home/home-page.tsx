                                <p>Pat Bot is a silly <a href="https://discordapp.com" target="_blank">Discord</a> bot named after my cat that I rescued
                                back in 2013. It was created one evening when I was bored and wanted to start a new project. I had just recently
                                found <a href="https://discordapp.com" target="_blank">Discord</a> and created a server for my World of Warcraft guild and
                                after browsing through a few bots I thought why use these when I can create my own. So I did.</p>

                                <p>Pat Bot is currently a very simple bot with just a few <Link to={'commands'}>commands</Link> that involves a couple pictures
                                of Pat herself, some WoW related memes and gifs, and other random things such as Giphy and YouTube search. I do have plans to
                                expand Pat Bot into something a bit more complex, but this is just a hobby project that Iâ€™m using as platform to learn and expand my
                                experience as a programmer.</p>

                                <p>Some feature ideas include reminders, WoW armory, Twitch streamer notifications, and custom commands through a web interface.</p>

                        <p>Pat Bot is currently hosted and should always be available. You can invite Pat Bot to a Discord server if you
                        have the <strong>Manage Server</strong> permission. Currently Pat Bot does not require any special permissions to run.</p>
